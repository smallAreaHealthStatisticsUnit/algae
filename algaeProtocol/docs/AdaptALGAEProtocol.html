		<meta name="description" 
		content="The ALGAE Protocol, an automated protocol for assessing early life exposures in longitudinal cohorts.  
		ALGAE can be used to help assess exposures to pollutants for members of longitudinal cohorts.  For each study
		member, exposures are aggregated by pollution type (eg: PM10, NOX, NAME), by life stage (eg: T1, T2, T3) and by 
		aggregate operation (ie: cumulative, average, median).  Exposures are calculated using four methods, each of
		which uses a different way of using parts of residential address history records.  The records are assumed
		to come from an administrative system that is used to audit current addresses of study members rather than
		a research system that is used to track past addresses of study members.">

<h1>Adapt the Code</h1>
We expect that there are three main ways that projects may want to adapt
the ALGAE protocol to better suit their needs:
<ul>
<li>
adjust life stage boundaries for early life analyses
</li>
<li>
add or remove life stages for the later life analysis
</li>
<li>
change one or more of the pollutants
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here we provide some suggestions about how you would do these tasks.  
Please note however that any changes you make to the code will likely cause
the test suites to fail.  However, if you're confident that ALGAE works
correctly, this may not be a problem.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="change_life_stages">
How do I change the life stages?
</a>
</h2>
The easiest way to learn how to change the life stages is to look for 
the tag "#CHANGE_LIFE_STAGES" in the code base.  It will take you to
the part of the code in the function <code>early_calc_life_stages</code>
that specifies default stages of T1, T2, T3 and EL.

<p>
Definitions of life stages will appear like the following snippet of code: 
<pre>
		 SELECT
		 	person_id,
			'T2' AS life_stage,
			birth_date,
			(conception_date + INTERVAL '92 days')::date AS start_date,
			(conception_date + INTERVAL '183 days')::date AS end_date
</pre>

<p>
In this case, if you wanted to change the name of the life stage <code>T2</code> to 
<code>Trimester 2</code>, you would first do a global search-and-replace on the 
phrase "'T2'" with "'Trimester 2'".  If you wanted to change the temporal boundaries, 
you would adjust the numbers in the phrases <code>'92 days'</code> and 
<code>'183 days'</code>.  <b>Remember: however you change the temporal boundaries for 
a life stage, ensure that they are temporally contiguous with other life stages</b>.
</p>

<p>
Please exercise care when you change the life stages in the early life analysis.  
ALGAE performs checks that fix T2 and T3 periods so that they do not overlap with
the EL period, which by default begins at birth.  The protocol does the checks to
correct for problems that occur in calculations when the <code>estimated_gestation_age</code>
value reflects a very premature birth.
</p>

<p>
If you want to change the life stage definitions for the later life analysis,
you will need to look at similar code in <code>later_calc_life_stages</code>.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="change_covariates">
How do I change the covariates?
</a>
</h2>
The advice here is similar to that we suggest for changing pollutants.  ALGAE
attaches no significance to <code>ed91</code>, <code>oa2001</code>, 
<code>coa2011</code> - they are just treated as identifiers that will be used
by researchers to link exposures to covariate data sets.  Search for the 
covariate linking field <code>oa2001</code> to better understand where you 
may have to add or edit code.

<h2>
<a name="change_pollutants">
How do I change the pollutants?
</a>
</h2>
ALGAE does not attach meaning to any of the pollutant values: NAME, NOX,
PM10 are just numeric fields that are used in aggregate calculations.  
The easiest way to use other pollutants is to carefully go through and 
search-and-replace one of the existing pollutants.  For example, you could replace 
a pollutant like <code>pm10_rd</code> with <code>radon</code>.
