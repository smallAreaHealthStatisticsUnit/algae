<h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>
<i>
by Kevin Garwood and Daniela Fecht
</i>
</p>

<p>
The ALGAE Protocol in its current form, supports two types of analyses: an early 
life analysis and a later life analysis. In the early life analysis, daily exposure 
estimates are aggregated over the first (T1), second (T2) and third (T3) pregnancy 
trimester and infancy from date of birth to the end of the first year of life (EL). 
In the later life analysis, annual exposures estimates are assigned to life years 
1 to 15 (YR1…YR15). The analyses are the same except for the temporal resolution 
of exposure data they use (i.e. daily versus annual averages).
</p>

<a name="preprocess"></a>
<h2>1 Pre-process original data tables</h2>
The ALGAE Protocol pre-processes the input tables in order to make the software 
more generic in terms of field values that different cohort studies may create. 
ALGAE, for example, standardises the representations of null (eg: <code>null</code>,
<code>#NULLIF</code>, <code>NULL</code>), 
yes (eg: <code>Yes</code>, <code>yes</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>Y</code>, 
<code>true</code>) or no (eg: <code>No</code>, <code>no</code>, <code>n</code>, 
<code>N</code>, <code>false</code>). The pre-processed 
versions of the input tables are re-named and begin with <code>staging_</code>. 
For example, pre-processing alters a copy of <code>original_geocode_data</code> 
to create a table called <code>staging_geocode_data</code>.

<a name="system_checks"></a>
<h2>2 Perform preliminary system checks</h2>
ALGAE tries to make assertions that certain table fields are null or unique.  These checks
help detect any errors that may exist in the cohort data sets as early as possible.

<a name="prepare_exposure_data"></a>
<h2>3 Ensure daily exposure records are ready to use</h2>
ALGAE processes daily exposure estimates for the early life analysis. In the later 
life analysis, an exposure record has the same fields but uses annual average 
exposures. In later life analyses, the date is always expected to be January 1st 
of a calendar year. The annual exposure records are converted to daily exposure 
records to harmonise the further analysis. 

<a name="calculate_life_stages"></a>
<h2>4 Calculate life stages</h2>
Life stages are calculated for each cohort member. In the early life analysis, 
the temporal boundaries for life stages T1, T2, T3 and EL are calculated. In the 
later life analysis, temporal boundaries are calculated for life stages YR1, 
YR2, YR3, etc. The early life analysis includes additional code to account for 
premature births. When cohort members are born prematurely, the protocol corrects 
problems in life stages, and will change the end date of T2 or T3 to reflect the 
premature date of birth, or that T3 is missing altogether. The life stage 
calculations ensure that trimesters will not overlap: in other words, each 
relevant day of a person's life will belong to exactly one life stage.

<p>
As well as the temporal boundaries of life stage, the temporal boundaries for the 
overall exposure time frame are calculated. For example in the early life analysis, 
the time frame would be from the day of conception until the end of the first year 
of life calculated as: <code>[conception date, birth date + 1 year - 1 day]</code>.
</p>

<a name="clean_address_periods"></a>
<h2>5 Clean address periods</h2>
<b>5.1 Impute blank start and end dates.</b> 
Impute blank start and end dates. First, ALGAE ensures that each address period has 
non-blank values for its start date and end date. When a start date is missing, 
the protocol imputes the value with the cohort member's date of conception. When 
the end date is missing, the value is set to the current date.
  
<figure class="explanation_figure">
<img src="./images/ImputeBlankDates.jpg" width=600>
<figcaption><b>Imputing blank dates</b>.  Blank start dates are filled with conception
dates and blank end dates are filled with the current date.
</figcaption>  
</figure>

<p>
<b>5.2 Order address periods</b>.  
Once any blank values have been imputed, the address periods are ordered first by 
the study member ID, then by the start date, then by the duration of the period 
at the address.  Once sorted, the order is maintained for the rest of the protocol.  
</p>

<figure class="explanation_figure">
<img src="./images/AddressPeriodSorting.jpg" width=600>

</figcaption>  
</figure>

<p>
At this point in the protocol ALGAE begins to track data cleaning changes using 
sensitivity variables.
</p>


<p>
<a name="fixable_bad_geocodes"></a>
<b>5.3 Identify and try to fix bad geocodes</b>.  Before ALGAE attempts to clean the 
temporal boundaries of successive address periods, it tries to identify and fix
bad geocodes.  A bad geocode is one which is either 
<a href="./ALGAETerminology.html#invalid_geocode">invalid</a> or 
<a href="./ALGAETerminology.html#oob_geocode">out-of-bounds</a>.  If study members 
have an address period which is within their exposure time frame and has a bad
geocode, it means that their exposure will not be calculated - they are left out
of exposure analysis altogether.
</p>


<p>
In order to reduce the impact of bad geocodes, ALGAE tries to fix those which 
it believes represent an incorrect address which is fixed in the following address
record.  The diagram below illustrates the criteria for identifying an 
address period which has a bad geocode that can be fixed.
</p>

<p>
<figure class="explanation_figure">
<img src="./images/IdentifyFixableBadGeocode.jpg" width=600>
<figcaption><b>Identifying bad geocodes that could be fixed</b>.
</figcaption>  
</figure>
</p>

<p>
If an address period, a<sub>n</sub>, is identified as having a geocode that is
"fixable" then:
<ol>
<li>
<code>
a<sub>n+1</sub>.start_date = a<sub>n</sub>.start_date
</code>
</li>
<li>
a<sub>n</sub> is marked with 
</li>
</ol>

Address periods whose geocodes are "fixable" are flagged to be ignored in future
data cleaning.  If a<sub>n</sub>.is_fixed_invalid_geocode=Y.  This marks 
the period and it will be ignored from all future cleaning as if it didn't exist.
Note that this is not the same as marking a period for deletion, as what can
happen later in the methodology.
</p>

<p>
<figure class="explanation_figure">
<img src="./images/FixBadGeocode.jpg" width=600>
<figcaption><b>Fixing a bad geocode</b>.
</figcaption>  
</figure>
</p>

<p>
<a name="fix_gaps_overlaps"></a>
<b>5.4 Identify and fix temporal gaps and overlaps</b>. 
Once the address periods have been ordered by <code>person_id</code>,
<code>start_date</code> and <code>duration</code>, ALGAE proceeds to identify
any gaps or overlaps that may appear in the residential address histories.
The protocol scans the address periods and flags each one depending on the 
fit that exists between successive address periods.  
</p>

<p>
<figure class="explanation_figure">
<img src="./images/IdentifyGapsAndOverlaps.jpg" width=600>
<figcaption><b>Identify gaps and overlaps</b>.  The numerical sign of the 
difference between a<sub>n+1</sub>.start_date and a<sub>n</sub>.end_date is used 
to determine whether two successive address periods a<sub>n</sub> and a<sub>n+1</sub>
are temporally contiguous, show a gap or show an overlap.
</figcaption>  
</figure>
</p>

<p>
Once address periods have been marked for gaps and overlaps, ALGAE begins to fix
them so that they are temporally contiguous.  In any address period, the
<code>start_date</code> values are assumed to provide a much stronger and more reliable
signal of location than <code>end_date</code> values.  The assumption is based on
the idea that in an administrative system, start dates will likely correspond to
time stamps but end dates will likely be computed in relation to start dates.
</p>.

<p>
<figure class="explanation_figure">
<img src="./images/FixGapsAndOverlaps.jpg" width=600>
<figcaption><b>Fix gaps and overlaps</b>.  Fixing gaps and overlaps always favours
preserving the <code>start_date</code> of address periods.  
</figcaption>  
</figure>
</p>

<b>5.5 Ensure that every day of exposure time frame is covered by an address period</b>.
It is likely that there will be a gap between date of conception and the date of enrolment 
in the cohort study.  It may also be possible in the early or late analysis
that the end date of the last available address period fails to cover days at the end
of the exposure time frame.  In order to ensure that all days of an exposure time frame
are covered, ALGAE will adjust boundaries of first and last relevant address periods.

</p>

<a name="calculate_exposures"></a>
<h3>6 Calculate Exposures</h3>
Once ALGAE has geocoded residential addresses and cleaned the address periods, it then 
matches the appropriate daily exposure estimates based on the locations that a study 
member occupied on each day covered by their cleaned residential address histories.  
Each exposure record has a <code>person_id</code>, a <code>geocode</code>, 
a <code>date_of_year</code> and daily pollution estimates for various pollutants.

<p>
The exposure records are used in different ways to assess exposures for early
and later life analyses.
</p>  

<a name="assess_exposure_quality"></a>
<h4>6.1 Assess the Data Quality of Each Daily Exposure Value</h3>
ALGAE assesses exposures based on aggregating daily exposure values, some of which may
be part of bad address periods that the protocol cannot fix.  For example, if study
members live at an invalid residential address for their entire gestation period, we 
cannot ignore this problem when we assess their trimester exposures.  

<p>
The protocol's frequent encounters with bad address periods led us to design it so
that it could report data quality indicators showing the extent to which life stage
assessments were affected by various kinds of bad address periods.  Before we discuss
the different ways ALGAE aggregates daily exposure values, we need to cover how it 
grades exposure values.

<p>
ALGAE classifies all daily exposure values based on five mutually exclusive 
categories which are evaluated in the context of each pollutant.  They are described
in the diagram below:
</p>

<figure class="explanation_figure">
<img src="./images/DailyExposureDataQualityCategories.jpg" width=800>
<figcaption><b>Categories used to describe the quality of each exposure value</b>.  
Blank start dates are filled with conception
dates and blank end dates are filled with the current date.
</figcaption>  
</figure>


<p>
ALGAE determines the category by answering three questions about each relevant 
address period:
<ol>
<li>
Is the geocode for the address period associated with at least one non-null
exposure value for a given pollutant?
</li>  
<li>
Is the geocode for the address period valid?
</li>
<li>
For a given day within the address period coverage, is there an associated exposure
value?
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>The answer to the first question tells ALGAE if there is any exposure data 
associated with the geocode.  If there are no exposure values available, then we
can draw one of two conclusions about the location for an address period:
<ul>
<li>it is an invalid geocode and this would explain why no exposure values exist</li>
<li>it is a valid geocode but it isn't in the study area that was used for exposure
modelling - the study member moved outside the study area</li>
</ul>

<p>The protocol looks up the geocode in the <code>staging_geocode_data</code> and 
determines the value of its <code>has_valid_geocode</code> field.  If the value is 
<code>N</code>, then this describes the <b>invalid address</b> scenario.  If it is
<code>Y</code>, then the circumstances describe the <b>out of bounds</b> scenario.

<p>
If an address period's geocode is associated with at least some exposure values,
it doesn't necessarily mean they are good values. Some projects may try to make 
a guess about the coordinates that should be associated with a poorly specified
residential address.  For example, suppose a person's address is simply "Pine St",
but the street is fifteen blocks long.  For some projects, exposure scientists may
try to pick the coordinates for the middle of the street.  The coordinates could be
used to generate exposures, even though the coordinates may not be accurate.  Human 
or software-based geocoding agents may flag a geocode as being invalid, even if it
is used to generate exposures.  These circumstances describe the <b>poor address</b>
scenario.
</p>

<p>
The protocol is left with two remaining categories to consider.  An address period may
have a valid geocode that is associated with some exposures for a given pollutant.
However, for specific days, there may not be exposure values available.  This may occur
if the temporal coverage of the exposure modelling does not cover all days that are 
in the exposure time frames. Should this happen, then we have the <b>missing exposure</b>
scenario.  If a day can actually be associated with a non-empty exposure value, then
this describes the <b>good address</b> scenario.
</p>

<p>
When the address periods are linked with daily exposure values, ALGAE assigns one of 
these categories for each kind of pollutant.  There is an assumption that the 
pollutants values should be treated independently of one another.  For example, a study
may have <code>PM10_rd values</code> for a given month but not have <code>nox_rd</code> 
values.  This may mean the count for missing exposure days T1 is 30 out of 92 for 
<code>nox_rd</code> exposures but 0 out of 92 for <code>pm10_tot</code>.
</p>

<p>
When ALGAE aggregates daily exposure values, it also aggregates counts of the days that
can be labelled for each category.  In the exposure results, researchers can then use
the counts of invalid, out of bounds, poor match, missing, and good match days and the
life stage durations to establish threshholds of data quality for life stage exposures.
</p>

<a name="assess_exposures_different_ways"></a>
<h4>6.2 Aggregate Daily Exposure Methods Using Different Methods</h4>
Now that we've discussed how daily exposure values are rated for data quality, we
can discuss how different methods can aggregate them differently.  ALGAE runs 
multiple kinds of assessment to let researchers assess the extent that data cleaning
of address histories would affect their analyses.  Some of the other methods also 
provide a kind of bridge that allows the study to generate analyses that are 
compatible with those found in other research papers.  The various assessment 
methods are described in the following diagram:

<figcaption><b>ALGAE's exposure methods.
</b>. ALGAE matches daily exposure records with locations that study members occupied for each day of 
their cleaned residential address histories.  The daily records are then aggregated by life stage in
different ways.

</p>

<p>
The following diagrams illustrate how the exposure assessments choose daily exposure
values, and how they may use the locations for certain exposure days to represent 
longer exposure periods.
