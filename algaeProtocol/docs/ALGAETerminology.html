</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<a name="address_period">
Address period
</a>
</td>
<td>
Describes the period where a study member was at a given residential address.  An address
period comprises a <code>study_id</code>, a <code>geocode</code>, a <code>start date</code> 
and an <code>end date</code>.
</td>
</tr>

<tr class="generic_data_table_even_row">
<td>
<a name="assigned_geocode">
Assigned geocode
</a>
</td>
<td>
The location which the ALGAE data cleaning algorithm assigns to a study member for
a given day.  The location is determined based how the software adjusts start end end
dates of address periods to fix any temporal gap and overlap errors.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<a name="birth_address_assessment">
Birth Address Assessment
</a>
</td>
<td>

A method of assessing exposures that is only used in the early life
analysis.  The assessment method has the following characteristics:

<ol>
<li>
is based on the cleaned temporal boundaries of residential address periods
</li>
<li>
uses the location study members occupied at birth as their location for their
entire early life exposure period (eg: <code>T1.<sub>start_date</sub></code> to 
<code>EL.<sub>end_date</sub></code> inclusively).  Any other moves they may have 
made during <code>T1</code>, <code>T2</code>, <code>T3</code> or <code>EL</code> 
are ignored.
</li>
<li>
are not accompanied by exposure measurement error values.
</li>
</ol>


</td>
</tr>

<tr class="generic_data_table_even_row">
<td>
<a name="cleaned_mobility_assessment">
Cleaned Mobility Assessment
</a>
</td>
<td>
A method of assessing exposures which:
<ol>
<li>
is based on the cleaned temporal boundaries of residential address periods
</li>
<li>
considers the contributions of exposures from all address periods which overlap a study 
member's exposure period
</li>
<li>
is accompanied by exposure measurement error assessments for days that were fixed through
data cleaning efforts 
(See <a href="./CalculationsAndAlgorithms.html#exposure_measurement_error">Calculations and
Algorithms</a> for information about how errors are assessed).
</li>
</ol>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<a name="contention_day"></a>
Contention day
</td>
<td>
A day where a study member could be placed at more than one address.  A contention day
occurs when a temporal gap or overlap exists between successive address periods.  
</td>
</tr>

<tr class="generic_data_table_even_row">
<td>
<a name="invalid_geocode">
Invalid geocode
</a>
</td>
<td>
A geocode is invalid if it satisfies either of the following criteria:
<ul>
<li>
It has a blank value.  This means that you should see a blank value in the <code>geocode</code>
column of the <code>original_address_history_data</code> table
<code>original_geocode_data</code> table has a "Y" value for <code>has_valid_geocode</code>
</li>
<li>
It has a non-blank value, but its entry in the <code>original_geocode_data</code> table has a 
"N" for the field <code>has_valid_geocode</code>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The second criterion would suggest that your geocoding software tried its best to give a match for
a poorly specified residential address, but the quality of the guess was still unacceptably low.
</p>

<tr>
<td>
<a name="life_stage_mobility_assessment">
Life Stage Mobility Assessment 
</a>
</td>

<td>
A method of assessing exposures which:

<ol>
<li>
is based on the cleaned temporal boundaries of residential address periods
</li>
<li>
uses the location study members occupied on the first day of each life stage as
their location for the entirety of that life stage. Therefore moves made during
the life stage are ignored for exposure assessment.
</li>
<li>
are not accompanied by exposure measurement error values.
</li>
</ol>
</td>
</tr>

<tr class="generic_data_table_even_row">
<td>
<a name="name">
NAME
</a>
</td>
<td>
High altitude pollution that comes from outside the exposure area.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<a name="nox_rd">
NOX_rd
</a>
</td>
<td>
Nitrogen oxide pollution from roads.
</td>
</tr>

<tr class="generic_data_table_even_row">
<td>
<a name="opportunity_geocode">
Opportunity geocode
</a>
</td>
<td>
The alternative location that a study member could have occupied had data cleaning
not been applied to the address periods.  

<p>
Consider two successive address periods a<sub>n</sub> and a<sub>n+1</sub>.  If a gap exists 
between them, then the assigned geocode is a<sub>n+1</sub> because ALGAE will include those 
days in a<sub>n+1</sub>.  However, if cleaning had not happened, then the opportunity 
geocode would have been a<sub>n</sub>.
</p>

<p>
If an overlap exists between them, then the assigned geocode is again a<sub>n+1</sub> because
ALGAE favours preserving the start dates of a<sub>n+1</sub> at the expense of shrinking the
end date coverage of a<sub>n</sub>.  In this case, a<sub>n</sub> is again the opportunity
geocode.
</p>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<a name="oob_geocode">
Out-of-bounds geocode
</a>
</td>
<td>
A geocode is out-of-bounds if it satisfies both of the following criteria:
<ul>
<li>
It has a valid geocode.  This means the geocode has a non-blank value and that its entry in the 
<code>original_geocode_data</code> table has a "Y" value for <code>has_valid_geocode</code>
</li>
<li>
It is not associated with any exposure values.  This means that the geocode, while valid, should
not appear anywhere in the table <code>original_exposure_data</code> table.
</li>
</ul>

A method of assessing exposures which:

<li>
is based on the cleaned temporal boundaries of residential address periods
</li>
<li>
considers the contributions of exposures from all address periods which overlap a study 
member's exposure period
</li>
<li>
ignores <a href="#contention_day">contention days</a> from exposure calculations

is not accompanied by exposure measurement error values
