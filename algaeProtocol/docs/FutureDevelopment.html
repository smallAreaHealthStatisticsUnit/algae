<h1>Future development</h1>
<p>

<p>
As ALGAE continues to be used and adapted to support other projects, we will
likely need to consider making improvements on the existing protocol.  Below,
we share our thoughts about two ideas that could be used to make future 
releases.


<h2>
Limit the effect of bad geocodes
</h2>
Currently, if study members have at least one address period within their
exposure time frame that has a bad geocode, and that bad geocode cannot be
<a href="./ALGAEMethodology.html#fixable_bad_geocodes">fixed</a>,
then they are excluded entirely from exposure assessments.

<p>
In future, the protocol should be adapted so that only the life stages
that contain address periods with bad geocodes are excluded from assessment.
For example, if there is a bad geocode in T2, the exposures could still be
calculated for T1, T3, and EL periods.
</p>

<h2>
Develop the concept of the proxy error
</h2>
Currently, ALGAE's <a href="./ALGAEGlossary.html#contention_day">contention days</a>
are only produced when there is a gap or an overlap between successive address 
periods.  However, a far more significant source of contention days for many
projects would come from the lag time between when someone moved to an address
and when they began living there.

<p>
For example, consider the scenario shown in the diagram below.  A study member decides
to mail a change of address to the cohort facilities and move on May 3, 1995.  Assume
that it takes three days for a letter to reach the cohort offices. A cohort administrator 
opens the mail showing the change on May 6 and immediately updates
the study member's record.  The start date at a<sub>2</sub> will be listed as
May 6, but the actual move date would be May 3.
</p>

<figcaption><b>Understanding proxy error</b>.  The start dates are used as a proxy
for when study members begin living at an address, but they will likely
represent when their change of address is recorded by cohort staff.
</figcaption>  
</figure>

<p>
In future releases, it may be useful to clean the address periods, and then calculate a 
+/- X days that represents the lag between the date of a move and the date when it was
reported.  Applying the proxy error would create days of contention, whether or not
they were covered by gap or overlap errors in the administrative data.
