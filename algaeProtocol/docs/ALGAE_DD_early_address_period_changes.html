<h1>ALGAE Data Dictionary: Early life address period changes (algae2100-algae2133)</h1>

<p>
<i>
by Kevin Garwood
</i>
</p>

<h2>Context of Variables</h2>
These variables describe the original address periods used in early life analysis and
all the changes that were made to them so they could be used in an exposure assessment.
Although most of the variables would have the same value as address period variables used
in the later life analysis, there are some key differences.  The variable
<code>algae2128_is_within_exp</code> indicates whether or not the address period 
overlaps with a study member's exposure period.  There is a similar variable
<code>algae2228_is_within_exp</code> for the later life analysis.
</p>

<p>
Both of these variables depend on the duration of the study member's exposure period.  In 
early life, this could be <code>[conception date, last day of first year]</code>, whereas in 
later life analyses, this could be <code>[yr1.start_date, year15.end_date]</code>.  You should
expect that these field values may appear different for the same address period, depending on
whether you are running an early life or later life analysis.
</p>

<h2>Location of Result File</h2>
You will find these variables in a file having a name that fits the form:

<pre>
res_early_cleaned_addr[Date stamp].csv
</pre>

which will be found in the directory:

<pre>
early_life/results/cleaned_address_history
</pre>

or

<pre>
later_life/results/cleaned_address_history
</pre>

<h2>Example Result File</h2>
See <a href="./example_results/res_early_cleaned_addr2016-Oct-24-22-47.csv">here</a>.

<h2>Variable Naming Conventions</h2>
The basic format of variables in this section follows this
pattern:

<pre>
	algae21[00-32]_[base variable name]
</pre>

<p>
In this pattern, <code>algae21</code> indicates that the variables relate to the address periods,
as they were used within the early life assessment.  Two other common phrases that appear
within variable names here are:
<ul>
<li>
<code>_adj_</code>: adjusted
</li>
<li>
<code>_within_exp</code>: within exposure period.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

if it is a study member's first address period and the start date needs to be changed
so that it covers all the time from the date of conception through to the date when
he or she was first enrolled in the study.

<p>
Moving the start date back to the conception date is not treated as a change that warrants
assessing the kind of exposure measurement error that is associated with gaps and overlaps.
Instead, we rely on sensitivity variables to indicate how certain we can be that the
study members occupied their first address when they were being conceived.
