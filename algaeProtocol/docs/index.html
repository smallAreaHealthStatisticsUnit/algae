		content="The ALGAE Protocol, an automated protocol for assessing early life exposures in longitudinal cohorts.  
		ALGAE can be used to help assess exposures to pollutants for members of longitudinal cohorts.  For each study
		member, exposures are aggregated by pollution type (eg: PM10, NOX, NAME), by life stage (eg: T1, T2, T3) and by 
		aggregate operation (ie: cumulative, average, median).  Exposures are calculated using four methods, each of
		which uses a different way of using parts of residential address history records.  The records are assumed
		to come from an administrative system that is used to audit current addresses of study members rather than
		a research system that is used to track past addresses of study members.">

ALGAE is an automated protocol which can be used to assess historical exposures to 
air pollution for members of longitudinal cohorts. It was developed as part of a 
research project between Imperial College's <a href="http://www.sahsu.org">Small Area Health 
Statistics Unit</a> (SAHSU) and the <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/">Avon Longitudinal Study 
of Parents and Children</a> (ALSPAC).

<p>
Although it was initially designed to support an exposure study that involved air pollutants and
respiratory health outcomes, it was later made into a generic solution which could be adapted to
support different life stages and pollutants.  ALGAE is intended as a generic exposure study protocol
that can generate reusable exposure data set that can be linked with various health outcomes.
</p>

<p>
Please note that the exposure results and test cases have been developed to support the
original SAHSU-ALSPAC study. However, it is very likely that other studies would want
to change the life stages, the pollutants or the covariates to make the protocol work
for them.  Please see our sections on 
<a href="./AdaptALGAEProtocol.html">adapting the code</a>.
