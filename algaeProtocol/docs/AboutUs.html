		content="The ALGAE Protocol, an automated protocol for assessing early life exposures in longitudinal cohorts.  
		ALGAE can be used to help assess exposures to pollutants for members of longitudinal cohorts.  For each study
		member, exposures are aggregated by pollution type (eg: PM10, NOX, NAME), by life stage (eg: T1, T2, T3) and by 
		aggregate operation (ie: cumulative, average, median).  Exposures are calculated using four methods, each of
		which uses a different way of using parts of residential address history records.  The records are assumed
		to come from an administrative system that is used to audit current addresses of study members rather than
		a research system that is used to track past addresses of study members.">

The ALGAE protocol was produced through a joint collaboration between 
Imperial College's <a href="http://www.sahsu.org">Small Area Health Statistics Unit<a/>
and the University of Bristol's <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/">ALSPAC</a> cohort.  
It was developed as a generic automated solution to support work in an environmental health
study that is examining the relationship between early life exposure to
air pollution and later life respiratory health in cohort members.

<p>
The project has been as much a collaboration between the data management teams
of SAHSU and ALSPAC as it has been a collaboration between its research teams.  
Many people from both teams have been involved with the project and their contributions 
are described in detail below.

Provided reasons why exposure days might be missing from the exposure data that
