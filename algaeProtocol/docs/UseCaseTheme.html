<h1>
Main Use Case Theme
</h1>
<p>
<i>
by Kevin Garwood

</p>

ALGAE was originally developed to support a specific environmental health study, and
was later generalised both in response to the environment in which it was deployed and
in response to growing interest from other environmental health researchers who may
want to use it.

<p>
ALGAE was designed to use residential address histories of cohort study members to 
assess their exposures to various pollutants, using historically assessed exposure 
values within an exposure area. It was made to support notions of an early life 
analysis and a later life analysis to fit a time frame that is of interest in early 
life environmental health studies.  The early life analysis begins at conception and 
will typically end at some point in the first year of life.  The later life analysis 
begins at the date of birth and uses year long life stages that typically end at in 
the 16th year of life.  
</p>

<p>
The protocol cleans the residential address histories so that study members occupy 
exactly one location for each day of their exposure time frame (e.g.: conception until 
the end of first year of life).  The daily locations are mapped to historically 
assessed pollution data to make daily exposure values.  These are then aggregated 
based on life stage.  
</p>

<p>
Along with aggregating daily exposure values, ALGAE attempts to assess daily exposure 
error values and one of five mutually exclusive data quality measure of each value.  
The exposure error is based on an opportunity cost mechanism that is applied to any 
day that is involved in a gap or overlap in address periods that may occur in the 
original residential address histories.  
</p>

<p>
The data quality measures are expressed in numbers of days.  Scientists would use the 
day counts for various categories (e.g.: days spent at an invalid address, at an out of 
bounds address etc.) and the total days for a given life stage to produce thresholds of 
data quality that would let them filter results as is appropriate for their studies.
</p>

<p>
ALGAE's reliance on daily exposure values allows it to support multiple assessment methods.  
These methods will vary based on whether they include days that have been affected by data 
cleaning, and whether they use contributions from all locations or just those that happen at 
key dates.
