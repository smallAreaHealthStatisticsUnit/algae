<h2>Purpose</h2>
The data in this table are used for two main tasks:
<ul>
<li>
to calculate the time boundaries for life stages
</li>
<li>
to use the responses from cohort questionnaire variables to determine how certain
we can be about assumptions we make about the residential address histories.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please see <a href="#">Life stage calculations</a> to understand how <code>birth_date</code>
and <code>estimated_gestation_age</code> are used to calculate life stage data.
</p>

<p>
We need to have a field <code>absent_during_exp_period</code> which indicates whether study 
members spent significant amounts of time located at residential addresses that are not listed
in their address histories.  We also need a field <code>at_1st_addr_conception</code> to tell
us whether study members were definitely at their first address during conception.
</p>

<h2>Location of Original Data File</h2>
You will need to create a file that has this name

<pre>
original_study_member_data.csv
</pre>


which must be located in:

<pre>
early_life/input_data
</pre>

or

<pre>
later_life/input_data
</pre>

<h2>Example Original Data File</h2>
See <a href="./example_original_data/original_exposure_data.csv">here</a>.


<h2>Suggested Approach</h2>

<img src="./images/PrepareStudyMemberDataWorkflow.jpg">
<figcaption>Preparing study member data.</figcaption>  
</figure>

<h3>Step 1: Obtain person_id, birth date and gestation age at birth fields</h3>
The first task in preparing to use the ALGAE protocol will be to assign study members with
an identifier, which may anonymised or pseudonymised depending on the preferences of the
cohort.  Birth date and gestation age at birth data are likely to come from birth records
and should be part of any birth cohort's variables.

<h3>Step 2: Find questionnaire data related to establishing an address at conception</h3>
Many birth cohorts recruit pregnant mothers to enrol their child.  The first address
that is recorded is usually the address the mother specified at enrolment, which may not
have been the location she lived at when the child was conceived.  In many cases the 
address at enrolment will be the address at conception, but we want a flag to help us
assess how confident we can be about this assumption.

<p>
The flag <code>at_first_addr_conception</code> is 'Y' if the study was <i>definitely</i>
at their first recorded address at conception.  Otherwise, the value must be 'N'.  

<h3>
Step 3: Find questionnaire data to detect locations used that are not in residential 
address histories
</h3>
The ALGAE Protocol assumes that study members only occupied addresses that are listed in
their residential address histories.  However, we want a data quality flag to help us
determine whether they spent any significant part of their exposure period living at
addresses that are not part of their address histories.

<p>
Look for variables related to homelessness, hospitalisation, prison or visits outside the
exposure area you would assume are not listed in the residential address histories.  Focus
specifically on variables that would be relevant during the exposure time frame.
</p>

<h3>General Advice</h3>
You may have to re-purpose a collection of questionnaire variables so that taken together, 
the responses can provide a value for the <code>at_1st_addr_conception</code> and 
<code>absent_during_exp_period</code> flags.

<p>
For example, we encountered three questions in the ALSPAC questionnaires that could help
us be confident in determining whether study members were definitely at their addresses
of enrolment when they were conceived.

<p>
Consider the following questions:

<pre>
Variable a003: years since last move?
Responses:
	'YE short'
	'Missing'
	0
	1
	2
	3
	4
	5+
</pre>

<pre>
Variable a004: weeks since last move?
Responses:
	'Missing'
	0...49 weeks
</pre>

<pre>
Variable c470: Are you living in the same home that you were in at the start of your 
pregnancy?
Responses
	'Missing' -2 or -1
	'y' 1
	'n' 2
</pre>

<p>
First, we had to divide responses for each question so they could provide a "Yes" or "No"
answer to the question: "Was the study member definitely at their first listed address at
conception?
</p>

<p>
You may find it helpful to construct a table like the one that follows to help organise
your questionnaire data:

<table class="generic_data_table">
<tr class="generic_data_table_header">
<th>Variable</th>
<th>Relevant Question</th>
<th>Yes/No Response</th>
<th>Values</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>a003</td>
<td>Definitely at first address?
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Any number greater than or equal to 1</td>
</tr>

<tr class="generic_data_table_even_row">
<td>a003</td>
<td>Definitely at first address?
<td>No</td>
<td>missing values or 0</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>a004</td>
<td>Definitely at first address?
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Any integer > 32 weeks</td>
</tr>

<tr class="generic_data_table_even_row">
<td>a004</td>
<td>Definitely at first address?
<td>No</td>
<td>Missing values or integer <= 32 weeks</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>c470</td>
<td>Definitely moved?</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Response of 2</td>
</tr>

<tr class="generic_data_table_even_row">
<td>c470</td>
<td>Definitely moved?</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>Any other response besides 2</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>
Once the values were converted to Yes or No responses, we had to rank questions
based on how strongly their responses would support a definite answer.  We decided
that if either a003 or a004 indicated that the study member had been at the first
address for a period that would cover conception, then we would accept the answer
"Yes".  Barring that, we would determine whether c470 would return a definite "No".
If this didn't happen, then by default we would return a "Yes", meaing that the
study member had been at his/her enrolment address at the time of conception.
</p>

<p>
Other scientists may have divided the responses differently and ranked the questions
with a different order of importance.  However, our assumptions have at least been
explicitly recorded.

<h2>Example Table</h2>
See <a href="./original_study_member_data.csv">here</a>.

<h2>Table Properties</h2>
You need to produce a CSV file called <code>original_study_member_data</code>.  It must
have the following fields:

<table class="original_data_table">
<tr class="generic_data_table_header">

<th>Description</th>
<th>Required</th>
<th>Properties</th>
<th>Examples</th>

When this value is missing, ALGAE imputes it with
a default value defined in <code>default_gestation_age</code> in the
