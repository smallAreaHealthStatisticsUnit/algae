		content="The ALGAE Protocol, An automated protocol for assigning early life exposures to longitudinal cohort studies.  
		ALGAE can be used to help assess exposures to pollutants for members of longitudinal cohorts.  For each study
		member, exposures are aggregated by pollution type (eg: PM10, NOX, NAME), by life stage (eg: T1, T2, T3) and by 
		aggregate operation (ie: cumulative, average, median).  Exposures are calculated using four methods, each of
		which uses a different way of using parts of residential address history records.  The records are assumed
		to come from an administrative system that is used to audit current addresses of study members rather than
		a research system that is used to track past addresses of study members.">

ALGAE is an automated protocol to assess historical exposure to air pollutants for 
members of longitudinal cohort studies. It was developed as part of a research 
project between the <a href="http://www.sahsu.org">Small Area Health Statistics
Unit</a>(SAHSU), Imperial College London and 
the <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/">Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents 
and Children</a>(ALSPAC).

<p>
Initially designed to support an environmental epidemiological study on air 
pollution exposure  during pregnancy and respiratory health effects in children, 
the protocol has since been developed into a generic solution which can be adapted 
to investigate different life stages and environmental pollutants. ALGAE is intended 
as a generic and reusable exposure study protocol to:
<ul>
<li>
reconstruct residential address histories of longitudinal cohort studies
</li>
<li>
assign exposure estimates  to cohort participants based on residential address
</li>
<li>
aggregate exposure estimates over different time periods such as pregnancy, infancy, 
and adolescence.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Initially ALGAE was designed to support a study on 
"Effects of early life exposure to particles on respiratory health through childhood and
adolescence".  It has since been developed into a generic solution which can be 
adapted to different cohort studies, life stages, health outcomes and environmental 
exposures.
</p>

<p>
For detailed description of the methodologies and algorithms used please see our 
section on <a href="./ALGAEMethodology.html">Methodology</a>.
</p>
<p>
The website is intended for people who want to: 
<ul>
<li>
Learn about information governance considerations when integrating exposure 
information into longitudinal studies
</li>
<li>
Learn from the ALGAE design before building their own software 
</li>
<li>
Adapt the ALGAE code to use in a different cohort study; 
</li>
<li>
Adapt the ALGAE code to suit different use cases within ALSPAC
</li>
<li>
Borrow parts of the code for other projects using ALSPAC data
<li>
</ul>
More information on the design decisions made in the development of 
ALGAE see our section on <a href="./DesignDecisions.html">Protocol Design</a>.

<p>
To support the protocol we have developed test cases using the SAHSU-ALSPAC as 
example.. The code can be modified to include different life stages, 
environmental pollutants or covariates.  Please see our sections on 
<a href="./AdaptALGAEProtocol.html">adapting the code</a>.
