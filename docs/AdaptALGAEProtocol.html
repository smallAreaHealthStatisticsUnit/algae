<h1>Adapting the ALGAE Protocol for Other Studies</h1>
<p>
<i>
by Kevin Garwood
</i>
</p>

The ALGAE protocol was originally designed to support a specific environmental health study 
that has been part of a collaborative activity between Imperial College and ALSPAC.  
However, early on the interest in reusing the data sets the protocol produced led us to 
consider ways in which the protocol could be generalised or adaptable to suit other studies 
or be applied to different cohorts.  

<p>
Before we consider how ALGAE could be adapted, it is worth reviewing the original use
case that the protocol was designed to support.  Please see Section 
<a href="./UseCaseTheme.html">Main Use Case Theme</a>.

<p>
If your study bears strong resemblance to the original use case study, then ALGAE may 
be adaptable for your own activities.  If it isn't, then I would suggest the most 
reusable part of the code for other projects may be the code that cleans address 
histories.  I suspect it would find a great many other applications in cases where 
it was necessary to produce a temporally contiguous address history for people.
</p>

<h2>View the Code</h2>
<p>
ALGAE has been open sourced through the 
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html">LGPL v3.0 license</a> and 
you can view the 
<a href="https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/algae">code repository</a></b>
on GitHub.
</p>

<h2>
Changing the Types of Exposures
</h2>
Other studies may want to analyse different exposures, such as ozone, radon, or pollen.   They 
may also want to express the same exposure type but through a different method.  For example, 
<code>ozone_meth1</code>, <code>ozone_meth2</code>, <code>ozone_meth3</code> may represent the 
pollutant concentration that has been assessed through different types of instruments or 
monitoring sources.

<p>
ALGAE attaches no meaning and gives no special treatment to any of its default exposure types.  
Although changing the exposure types is not a configurable option in the code, it is easy to 
modify the code.  ALGAE's consistent use of naming conventions should mean that substituting 
one of its existing exposure types for another is literally using a search and replace operation.  
For example, PM10 RD is always called either pm10_rd in the code or PM10 RD in the documentation.  
I would suggest the fastest way of adapting the code to support a new exposure type is to just 
search and replace an existing exposure type such as nox_rd.
</p>

<p>
In your original data tables, you could just leave all the other pollutant values blank.  ALGAE 
should work correctly and you would just ignore the empty contributions of the pollutants that 
were not relevant to your activity.  This is an inefficient way of running the protocol 
because the protocol would be processing many fields that would be considered irrelevant.  
However, from the perspective of minimising the effort needed to change the code, this is 
probably the best approach.
</p>

<p>
If you have more than the number of exposure types that ALGAE supports, then I would choose 
one exposure type (e.g.: <code>pm10_tot</code>) and find every occurrence of it in the code.  
Immediately below it, add an extra line (e.g.: <code>ozone_height_10m</code>).
</p>

<h2>
Changing the Default Gestation Age at Birth Value
</h2>
By default, ALGAE will fill in a blank gestation age at birth value with 38 weeks.
If this does not suit your needs, you can change it in the method
<code>setup_scripts(...)</code> in the file <code>Common_InitialiseGlobalConstants.sql</code>.  You can also find it by searching for the
phrase "<code>#CHANGE_DEFAULT_GESTATION_AGE</code>" in the codebase.

<h2>
Changing Conception Date Calculations
</h2>
ALGAE has a <a href="CalculationsAndAlgorithms.html#conception_date_calculation">default</a> way of calculating conception 
date.  If you want to change that, then you can change it by altering the method
<code>comm_cln_gest_age_at_birth()</code> in the code file
<code>Common_CalculateLifeStages.sql</code>.  You can search for
<code>#CHANGE_CONCEPTION_CALCULATION</code> in the code base.




<h2>
Changing the Life Stages
</h2>
Studies may want to use different life stages that cover a different exposure time frame and 
they may also choose to divide the same exposure time frame that ALGAE uses in different ways. 
The best examples of this are in the early life analysis, where researchers may have different 
opinions about the temporal boundaries of trimesters.  They may also choose to consider the 
first year of life or divide that up into smaller life stages.  

<p>
In general, ALGAE attaches little meaning to any of the life stages.  Its main assumption is 
that they do not exhibit gaps or overlaps.  It is possible for you to rename the life stages 
to something other than <code>YR1</code>, <code>YR2</code>.
</p>
<p>
ALGAE does attach significant to whatever life stage starts when the study member is born.  
By default this is <code>EL</code> but in another one of our study runs it was named differently.  It uses 
the meaning of this life stage to help it correct calculations of life stage boundaries in cases 
of very premature births.  If a study member is born prematurely enough, they will not have a 
T3.

<p>
If you need to change the life stages, then you need to alter code in one of two places:
<ul>
<li>
the method <code>early_calc_life_stages()</code>, which is found in 
<code>EarlyLife_CalculateLifeStages.sql</code> or
</li>
<li>
the method <code>late_calc_life_stages()</code>, which is found in 
<code>LaterLife_CalculateLifeStages.sql</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can also find more advice about how to change these methods by doing a search 
for <code>#CHANGE_LIFE_STAGES</code> in the code base.
</p>

<h2>
Turning Off the Feature for Fixing Bad Address Periods
</h2>
Before it cleans address histories, ALGAE tries to identify and fix certain kinds of bad 
address periods, where it is not clear where a study member was living.  In its development 
history, this fixing feature was created in an attempt to help prevent study members who 
had bad address periods in their exposure time frames from being excluded from further 
analysis.  It used a set of three criteria in order to identify scenarios where an incorrect 
change of address record was immediately followed by a corrected version of it.  By default, 
a bad address period is fixable if:
<ol>
<li>
it has an invalid geocode
</li>
<li>
it is immediately followed by an address period which does have a valid geocode
</li>
<li>
it does not overlap with any life stage by more than 25%
</li>
</ol>

<p>
We developed these criteria but in response to the nature of how address history data 
were originally gathered and by our own assessment of what bad address periods should 
be fixed.  However, our fixing feature has two weaknesses.  First, they may be viewed 
as capturing our view of what would identify a certain type of data entry error.  
Second, whereas we use 25%, others may have a different tolerance for overlap.
</p>

<p>
Later on, ALGAE was modified so that rather than excluding study members who had bad 
address periods in their exposure time frames, the protocol would simply keep track of 
how many days in a life stage could be associated with various categories used to 
describe the quality of daily exposure values.
</p>

<p>
Given the advent of that mechanism, some may conclude that fixing bad address periods 
introduces an element of judgement that would be better left out of assessments.  
If you want to disable the feature for fixing bad address periods, all of the relevant 
code is contained in the method <code>comm_id_and_fix_bad_geocodes(</code>), which is found within 
the file <code>Common_CleanAddressHistories.sql</code>.  The code you will need to change is well 
documented and can be found by searching for <code>#DISABLE_FIXING_BAD_ADDRESS_PERIODS</code> 
in the code base.
</p>

<h2>
Changing the Assumptions for Fixing Gaps and Overlaps
</h2>

<p>
ALGAE has facilities for fixing gaps and overlaps that may occur in the residential address 
histories.  The way we fix them is influenced by the characteristics of the database application 
that was originally developed to retain the most recent postal addresses of study members.  
</p>

<p>
In the original use case, we assumed that for any address period, a start date provided a 
stronger signal for location than end date.  When we developed the algorithm for fixing gaps and 
overlaps, we used the policy that we would wherever possible conserve the start date.  Our 
assumption was that study members were likely to have already been living at a location by the 
start date for the new location.  
</p>

<p>
These assumptions have influenced our way of fixing gaps and overlaps (See Section 
<a href="./ALGAEMethodology.html#fix_gaps_overlaps">Identify and fix temporal gaps and 
overlaps</a>).  However, in other studies, the residential address histories could warrant 
different assumptions.  

<p>
For example, the histories could be managed by an application that was actually designed to track 
someone's past addresses rather than audit their current addresses.  In this case, start date 
and end dates may provide an equally good signal for data quality.  
</p>

<p>
You would expect then that in such applications there would be no gaps or overlaps.  However, 
if there are, then there are at least two alternative approaches you may consider.  The first is to 
impute the exposures for days that have been involved with gaps or overlaps.  For example, for a 
gap day you could consider using an average of two exposures from the neighbouring locations.  
Perhaps the values would be imputed with some default exposure value for the exposure area.  
</p>

<p>
I would recommend you don't do this because I'm not sure how this would affect the code.  
Specifically, I'm not sure how such a scheme would work with calculations of exposure 
misclassification error (i.e. you thought they were at location a<sub>1</sub> but 
they were at location a<sub>2</sub>).
</p>

<p>
An alternative approach that could be supported by ALGAE would be to favour conserving end dates.  
I have trouble imagining an administrative system that would be more definite about end dates than 
start dates.  However, if you want to change how ALGAE fixes gaps and overlaps, you will need to 
change code in the method <code>comm_fix_gaps_and_overlaps()</code> in the code file 
<code>Common_CleanAddressHistories.sql</code>.  The code you would need to change can be found 
by searching for <code>#CHANGE_GAP_OVERLAP_BEHAVIOUR</code> in the code base.
</p>

<h2>
Disabling the Feature for Cleaning Gaps and Overlaps
</h2>
In the original use case, the address histories represented residential address histories.  One 
of the key assumptions we made was that in an address history, a person would have to live 
somewhere.  If they always had a location where they were living, then gaps and overlaps could 
be fixed to show a continual pattern of living locations.  

<p>
However, for some studies, the address histories might expect gaps to exist between address 
periods.  For example, if address histories represented the locations of main work places, 
then it is possible that study members would not be working for a period of time.  Therefore, 
it would not make sense to fix gaps in the record.  
</p>

<p>
If, for whatever reason, you don't want ALGAE to fix gaps and overlaps, then I would suggest 
it would be easiest if you ensured that the original address periods showed none of these problems. 
Where you want to preserve gaps between successive address periods, I would inject bad address 
periods into the histories that would be picked up in the end results.  For example, I would 
suggest using either a geocode called <code>not_applicable</code> or some out of bounds coordinate like 
the North Pole to help you gauge when study members weren't at an address that would contribute 
exposure to the study.
</p>

<p>
In order for this to work, you would then have to disable our feature for fixing bad address
periods.  Following our example, if in a year of life someone had a break of a week between jobs, 
then for that seven days they would not be at a location that would contribute to workplace 
pollution.  However, 7 days relative to a whole year of life is small, and ALGAE would try to 
remove the gap by assuming that it should really belong to the following work place.
</p>

<p>
As we have already discussed in this section, the code for disabling the fixing feature can be 
found by searching for <code>#DISABLE_FIXING_BAD_ADDRESS_PERIODS</code> in the code base.
